            "Thank you for carefully reading this information sheet. " +
            "This study is being conducted by student researcher Róisín Sharma, and project supervisor Dr David Schwartzman from the Sussex Center for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex (see contact information below). " +

            "<h4>Why have I been invited to take part and what will I do?</h4>" +
            "This study will compare stroboscopic hallucinations in people with grapheme-colour synesthesia to people without synesthesia. " +
            "Synesthesia is a condition where stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. People with grapheme-colour synesthesia experience specific colours when viewing letters and/or numbers. " +
            "The study also aims to investigate how individual differences relate to stroboscopic hallucinations. " +
            "You will then complete the in-person component of this study at the Univeristy of Sussex, which will involve stroboscopic light stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a short recorded interview and two questionnaires. This component will take approximately 60 minutes. " +
            "Results from this online component will be compared to your experiences during stroboscopic light stimulation. " +
            "<p>Before the beginning the study, you will confirm eligability for this study:</p>" +
